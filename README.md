# MultiOmicsFermentation

## Overview
MuliOmicsFermentation is a workflow for identifying the dynamics of microorganisms, pathways and metabolites during the fermentation process.
The final output is a multi-layered network, in which the layers are the different time points.
It uses different programming languages, in particular R, Python and Bash.

This is an image of the initial inputs, and final table obtained, from which the network is designed.
